# Sources

In Octohook, Sources are how we separate incoming webhooks from different platforms. Perhaps
you want to receive webhooks from Github and Segment, these would be two different Sources.

::: tip Source Limits
Our free plan has a hard limit of 3 sources, whilst upgrading to our paid plan allows
you to have up to 10 sources!

Each source gets its own unique URL that is used to receive webhooks, this can be viewed
and copied from the source details page, the same page where you can see all your webhooks
coming in, in real time.
