# Teams

There are two types of teams within Octohook, your 'personal' team which is just you, every
account is eligible for one personal team at any one time. This is your private
playground - dance like no one is watching! :dancer:

Then we have, well, team teams! When you are subscribed to one of Octohook's paid plans
then you have access to team management which allows you to add an unlimited number
of members to your team. Team member have full access to the source for your team
